Quarantine service for Rspamd
-----------------------------

Stores blocked by rspamd messages in mysql database and provides a simple GUI to find and get from quarantine the message you are looking for.

Requirements
------------

Web server with PHP support, PHP, Mysql

Setting up
----------

Create database using the database.sql file.

Put all the other files in the virtual host's root directory.

Change the settings.php file: specify database settings and rspamd hosts wich will be allowed to store messages in the quarantine service.

Since messages can be large, I recommend you to increase the maximum post size of your web server (in apache it's the post_max_size parameter).

I didnâ€™t do any authorization to access web GUI so if you need it you can configure it using htpasswd for example - https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/auth.html

Configure the Metadata Exporter module on each rspamd host by adding the rule like this:

```rules {
   QUARANTINE_1 {
      backend = "http";
      url = "http://quarantine_site/metadata.php";
      selector = "is_spam";
      formatter = "default";
      meta_headers = true;
   }
```}

The "selector" parameter can be "is_spam" or "is_reject". In the first case it will quarantine all messages with "reject" or "add header" action, in the second case it will quarantine only messages with "reject" action.
